## Comments

I did find this reminiscent of the project at work taking a huge website making it responsive in addition to modifying the design. It was a tedious task that required a lot of time reviewing the HTML and CSS.

One thing of note... even though I found the videos helpful to a point they way Richard bounced around did not help the learning process. In addition, there were elements in this assignment, calc and box-sizing, that were not covered. Interestingly, they are taught in the week 7 curriculum. As someone who taught in the military for over 20 years, a key component in successful instruction is not to include material in an assignment that has not been taught.
